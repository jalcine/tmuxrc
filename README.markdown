![Snapshot of my tmux environment](./snapshot.png)

This holds the configuration for my tmux setup. Right now, I target `tmux 2.1`
so you can expect this to work for that. I strongly recommend just looking at
the sources for things in my configuration - this README would go out of date
too quickly.
