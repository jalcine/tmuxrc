# keybindings!

# {{{1 General Options
# The default key-binding prefix for tmux is <C-b>. However, since tmux is
# like a window manager for the terminal, moving it to <C-a> would make it
# nearly natural to pressing <Alt-Tab>.
unbind C-b
set -gw prefix C-a

# Pass in the prefix!
bind-key b send-key C-a

# Allow for quick re-loading of the configuration.
# TODO Should we attempt to resource the host's ENV?
bind r source-file ~/.tmux.conf \;\

# Again, when you immediately hit <Alt-Tab>, it typically cycles to the last
# window you viewed (at least it does for me with KWin).
bind-key C-l last-window

# Oppa Vim-navigation Style! Seriously, this enables Vim-like pane navigation
# (keep the prefix held for even more fun).
bind-key h select-pane -L
bind-key j select-pane -D
bind-key k select-pane -U
bind-key l select-pane -R

# Even more awesome, break a pane into its own window.
bind-key g break-pane -F '[ðŸŽ“  tmux] Graduated into window #{window_index}.'

# Switch the layout from its current state to one of the pre-defined ones. Not
# something I use often, but it comes in handy so it's a bit out-of-reach.
bind ` next-layout

# Quickly split the window either vertically or horizontally. 
bind-key t split-window -h
bind-key v split-window -v

# Toggle the use of status.
bind-key q set status

# Toggle the activity listening.
bind-key V set-window-option monitor-activity

# Toggle sending to all panes.

# {{{ Mouse Bindings
# Toggle mouse on with <prefix>{M,m}
